# Web-Chat
Just a simple web ui chat script that is able to bypass school network firewalls. So you can chat with your friends that are on school computers while you host from your personal laptop


# Requirements
You don't really need anything fancy, the script just uses FLASK to run

```plaintext
pip install Flask
```

# How to run
So to run it you have to run the script ChatUI.py and that's it. Really simple to use

# How to change the background
There is a folder called static, go into there and a backgrounds folder will be in there. That is where you put in your background if you want to change it. Make sure to rename it to "background2"
