# Web-Chat
Just a simple web ui chat script that is able to bypass school network firewalls. So you can chat with your friends that are on school computers while you host from your personal laptop


# Requrements
You don't really need anything fancy, the script just uses FLASK to run

```plaintext
pip install Flask
```
